# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.0.6] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- Double-clicking a `.md` file (with mdpeek set as default) now actually opens
  it. Root cause: the old `setup` hook emitted an `open-file` event during app
  startup, before the frontend listener was registered — a race the event lost.
  Replaced with a pull-based `get_initial_file` command the frontend invokes
  once the DOM is ready, so there's no race.

## [0.0.5] - 2026-06-30

### Fixed
- Welcome-screen logo was broken in the installed app (404 on `/icon.png`).
  Root cause: Vite only bundles files under `public/` or imported assets; the
  root `icon.png` wasn't served. Fixed by adding `public/icon.png`.
### Changed
- Document pane now uses the full window width up to ~1100px (was capped at
  780px, leaving large empty side margins). Side padding scales with window
  width; widens further on large monitors (≥1400px).

## [0.0.4] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Version badge on the welcome screen (visible marker for confirming the
  running version after an auto-update).
- `scripts/copy-release.js` now matches the exact version being built, so it
  can't pick up a stale installer left in the nsis output dir from a previous
  build. (This was a real bug found during install testing — v0.0.3 builds
  were shipping the v0.0.1 binary.)

## [0.0.3] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- **File association**: `.md`, `.markdown`, `.mdx` now appear in the Windows
  "Open with" menu. Double-clicking a file with mdpeek set as default opens it
  directly. Registered via a custom NSIS hook (`src-tauri/nsis/file-assoc.nsh`).
- **Auto-update**: on startup the app checks GitHub Releases for a new version;
  if found, a click-to-install toast appears (downloads the signed installer,
  launches it elevated, and relaunches). Configured via `tauri-plugin-updater`
  with a self-generated signing keypair. Per-machine install means UAC prompts
  on each update — expected for Program Files apps.
- `scripts/make-release.js`: signs the installer, generates `latest.json`, and
  uploads both to the GitHub Release for the current version.

### Changed
- Updated bundled `latest.json` endpoint to `github.com/sanketpatel32/Mdpeek`.

## [0.0.2] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Modern minimal UI redesign: branded header with logo + wordmark, icon toolbar
  buttons with hover/active states, grouped toolbar with separators, styled
  scrollbars, slide-in toast, and a proper welcome hero / empty state.
- Per-machine installer: mdpeek now installs to `C:\Program Files\mdpeek\`
  (like VS Code) with a machine-wide Start Menu shortcut.
- `releases/` folder: `npm run tauri:build` copies the installer + portable
  binary into a clean top-level location.
- Project files: `.gitattributes`, `.editorconfig`, `CHANGELOG.md`,
  `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `LICENSE`.

### Changed
- Inline SVG icons replace text buttons (Open, Save, Edit, Theme).
- Theme toggle now swaps a sun/moon icon; smooth color transitions on switch.
- Refined markdown typography: better headings, accent-colored blockquotes,
  bordered code blocks, striped tables.

### Removed
- iOS and Android icon assets (35 files) — this is a Windows desktop app.
- Scaffolded `.vscode/extensions.json`.

## [0.0.1] - 2026-06-30

### Added
- Initial release.
- GitHub-flavored Markdown rendering (marked) with XSS sanitization (DOMPurify).
- Syntax-highlighted code blocks (highlight.js).
- Math rendering via KaTeX (`$inline$` and `$$block$$`).
- Mermaid diagram rendering (```` ```mermaid ```` fences).
- View mode with auto-generated table of contents.
- Edit mode with split-pane live preview (debounced).
- Live reload when the open file changes on disk (notify watcher).
- Drag-and-drop a `.md` file to open it.
- Light / dark theme.
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl+O` open, `Ctrl+S` save, `Ctrl+E` toggle edit.
- NSIS Windows installer (~3.2 MB).
- Unit tests for the renderer pipeline (10 passing).
